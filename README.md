# -Document-Classification-using-NLP-Machine-Learning

Perform document classification into four defined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). Compare the classifier accuracy with different models ranging from Naïve Bayes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and RCNN. By making use of different feature engineering techniques and extra Natural Language Processing (NLP) features create an accurate text classifier.

Document/Text Classification



Document/Text classification is an important task that has use cases in many real-world problems. Assigning topics to documents like news article, books, webpages, social media post has many applications like spam filtering, sentiment analysis, tagging customer queries, fake news detection etc. Natural language's vastly large size, unrestrictive nature, and ambiguity led to two problems when using standard parsing approaches that relied purely on symbolic, hand-crafted rules: unmanageable numerous rules and inability to understand ungrammatical text something which is human comprehensible easily. A problem statement apt for machine learning. NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner. By utilizing NLP and its components, one can organize the massive chunks of text data, perform numerous automated tasks and solve a wide range of problems such as – automatic summarization, machine translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation etc
